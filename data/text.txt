My Dearest Moon,

I'm writing to you because lately, I've felt a distance between us. It seems like you've been spending a lot of time with friends who don't share our faith as deeply. While I understand the importance of friendship, I'm worried about the influence they might be having on you, especially during this time when you're feeling emotional due to your period.

Our faith is incredibly important to me, and seeing you struggle with conflicting ideas is causing me some concern.  I miss the connection we have when we're both focused on strengthening our individual and shared faith.

Instead of focusing on blame, I want to propose a solution. Perhaps we could find a way to spend more quality time together, doing things that bring us closer to Allah and each other.  We could attend lectures by scholars we both respect, read Quran together, or even volunteer for a cause we care about.

On another note, I completely understand how your period can affect your mood.  Please know that I'm here for you during this time.  Is there anything I can do to make things easier for you?

Most importantly, I want you to know how much I love and cherish you.  Our marriage is a precious thing, and I want to work together to make it stronger.  Would you be open to talking about this more when you're feeling up to it?

With all my love,

Your king
